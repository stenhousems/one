#Ghostshell, v.0.1
##Michael Stenhouse

###About

Ghostshell is a shell written in Python that outputs public activity data for the game Destiny.
Data is requested from Bungie.net API and a JSON packet is returned and parsed.

Many thanks to destinydevs.github.io/BungieNetPlatform/ for their documentation of the API.
Also, thanks to allynh.com for the guide to actually understanding the API.

###Build instructions (for Ubuntu 16.04)

1. Install requests library with PIP
* Run `sudo apt-get install python-pip`
* Run `pip install requests`
2. Run `python ghostshell.py`

Ghostshell is written in Python 2.7, which comes installed with Ubuntu 16.04.

###Commands

* **"help"**: prints available commands and their functions
* **"nightfall"**: strike and modifiers for this week's Nightfall
* **"dailystory"**: the daily Story mission
* **"dailycrucible"**: the daily Crucible playlist
* **"weeklycrucible"**: the weekly Crucible playlist
* **"xur"**: Xur's inventory (only works on Friday and Saturday)

###Future versions?

* Allow user to see their weekly completion when their username and console are added as arguments, i.e. "nightfall XBOX gamertag"
* Allow access to user's inventory and vault
* Create custom loadouts and equip them with a command (!!!)
* Make the code more modular (definitely)
* Add a setup.py file for automatic dependency installation
